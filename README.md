# ANSI-Express
ANSI Express is a ANSI file viewer for Windows, developed in VB6. It has many features including support for emulated draw speeds, animated ANSI's, configurable rows/columns and text size.

I started working on this around 2004 as I wanted to learn more about the ANSI format and wanted a playback animated ANSI files on Windows. This was developed in Visual Basic 6.0. I recently discovered a backup of this old code so I am releasing it to github so I never lose it again.
